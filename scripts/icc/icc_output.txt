ARGUMENTS
       -clock_trees clock_sources
              Specifies the clock trees on which to set  the  specified  clock
              tree  options.   You specify the clock trees by using the source
              of each clock tree. The source can be a top-level  design  input
              port, a hierarchical port, or a library cell instance pin.

              If  you  do  not  specify the -clock_trees option, the specified
              clock tree options apply to all clocks defined  in  the  design.
              Note  that  some clock tree options are global options and apply
              to all clocks in  the  design  regardless  of  the  -clock_trees
              option.  These  global  options are noted in the option descrip-
              tion.

       -layer_list layer_names
              Specifies the layers that can be used for routing the clock nets
              in  the  specified  clock  trees.  If the list has more than two
              elements, the lower layer should appear before the upper  layer.

              By default, all routing layers can be used for clock nets.

       -layer_list_for_sinks layer_names
              Specifies the layers that can be used for routing the clock leaf
              nets in the specified clock trees.  If the list  has  more  than
              two  elements,  the  lower  layer should appear before the upper
              layer. This option overrides the -layer_list option when routing
              leaf-level clock nets, if both options are specified.

       -use_leaf_routing_rule_for_sinks count
              Forces the leaf routing rule or leaf layerlist to be used on the
              leaf nets that drive the clock tree sinks and nets at the bottom
              n-1 levels of the clock tree. A net is considered as leaf net if
              it drives at least one flip-flop or latch clock input  pin  that
              is  a  sink  pin or float or stop pin.  Any pins with exclude or
              don't touch subtree exceptions, as well as non-flip-flop or non-
              latch  clock  input  pins with float or stop exceptions, are not
              treated as sink pins of the clock tree for  this  purpose.   For
              example,  a  net that drives only one non-flip-flop float pin is
              not treated as a leaf net for this purpose.

              The default is 0, and the maximum allowed is 2.

              This option is valid only if the -routing_rule_for_sinks or  the
              -layer_list_for_sinks option is specified.

       -target_early_delay insertion_delay
              Specifies  the minimum insertion delay constraint in design unit
              for the specified clock trees.

              When you specify this option, the clock  tree  synthesis  engine
              builds  an  initial optimized clock tree. If the insertion delay
              of the longest path of this clock tree is smaller than the spec-
              ified  value,  the  clock  tree synthesis engine adds a chain of
              cells from the reference list as needed to meet this delay.

              By default, the target early delay is 0.

       -target_skew skew
              Specifies the required value for maximum skew in design unit for
              the specified clock trees.

              After  the tool meets this skew target, the optimization concen-
              trates more on other QoR goals,  such  as  insertion  delay  and
              area).

              By default, the target skew is 0.

       -max_capacitance capacitance
              Specifies the maximum capacitance design rule constraint in main
              library units for the specified clock trees.

              This value takes precedence over the  maximum  capacitance  con-
              straint  set  on the design, as well as over the one coming from
              the library. This constraint  is  used  when  reporting  maximum
              capacitance  violations  during clock tree synthesis and is also
              used to control maximum capacitance  DRC  fixing  beyond  excep-
              tions.

              By default, the maximum capacitance is 0.6 pf.

       -max_transition transition_time
              Specifies  the maximum transition time design rule constraint in
              main library unit for the buffers and inverters used while  com-
              piling the specified clock trees.

              This  value  takes  precedence  over the maximum transition time
              constraint set on the design, as well as  over  the  one  coming
              from the library, but can be overridden on all instances of spe-
              cific types of buffers and inverters in the clock tree by speci-
              fying   a   different   value   for   this   constraint  on  the
              set_clock_tree_references command line. The clock tree root cell
              and  clock-gating  cells  present  on  the clock network are not
              affected  by  the  set_clock_tree_references  design  rule  con-
              straints  unless they are instances of buffers or inverters with
              overridden design rule constraints.

              By default, the maximum transition time is 0.5 ns.

       -max_fanout fanout
              Specifies the maximum fanout  design  rule  constraint  for  the
              cells in the specified clock trees.

              By  default,  the maximum fanout constraint set on the design by
              using the set_max_fanout command, as well as the one coming from
              the library are ignored during clock tree synthesis.

              By default, the maximum fanout is 2000.

       -max_rc_delay_constraint delay
              Specifies  the  maximum RC delay constraint from a driver pin to
              each receiver pin while compiling  the  specified  clock  trees.
              This  constraint  is  for  the  delay  from a driver pin to each
              receiver pin.

              By default, the maximum RC delay constraint is disabled.

              This option is mutually exclusive with the  -max_rc_scale_factor
              option.

       -max_rc_scale_factor scale_factor
              Enables  the  maximum  RC delay constraint by specifying a scale
              factor while compiling the specified clock trees.  The  true  RC
              delay  constraint is determined by multiplying this scale factor
              by an internally derived RC delay. This constraint  is  for  the
              delay from a driver pin to each receiver pin.

              By default, the scale factor is not set and the maximum RC delay
              constraint is disabled.

              This option is mutually exclusive  with  the  -max_rc_delay_con-
              straint option.

       -routing_rule ndr_rule
              Specifies  the  nondefault  routing  rule to be used for routing
              nets in the specified clock trees.

              The default is to use the default routing  rule  for  all  clock
              nets.

       -use_default_routing_for_sinks count
              Forces the default routing rule to be used on the leaf nets that
              drive the clock tree sinks and nets at the bottom n-1 levels  of
              the  clock tree. A net is considered as leaf net if it drives at
              least one flip-flop or latch clock input pin  that  is  a  sink,
              float,  or  stop pin.  Any pins with exclude or don't touch sub-
              tree exceptions, as well as  non-flip-flop  or  non-latch  clock
              input  pins  with  float  or stop exceptions, are not treated as
              sink pins of the clock tree for this purpose.   For  example,  a
              net  that drives only one non-flip-flop float pin is not treated
              as a leaf net for this purpose.

              The default is 0.

              This option is valid only if the -routing_rule option is  speci-
              fied.

       -leaf_max_transition transition_time
              Specifies  the maximum transition time design rule constraint in
              main library unit for the buffers and inverters used while  syn-
              thesizing  the leaf nets during the compilation of the specified
              clock trees. A leaf net is defined as a  net  which  drives  the
              clock pin of at least one register, latch, or multibit register.

              This value must be tighter than the  value  specified  with  the
              -max_transition  option of the set_clock_tree_options command or
              the set_max_transition command.

              By default, the maximum transition constraint for the leaf  nets
              is equal to the maximum transition constraint of the rest of the
              clock tree.

       -use_leaf_max_transition_on_exceptions true | false
              Specifies if the maximum transition constraint applied  on  leaf
              level  nets by using the -leaf_max_transition option should also
              apply on nets connected to pins having exceptions on them.  This
              option  is  applicable only when the -leaf_max_transition option
              is specified.

              The default is false.

       -use_leaf_max_transition_on_macros true | false
              Specifies if the maximum transition constraint applied  on  leaf
              level  nets by using the -leaf_max_transition option should also
              apply on nets connected to pins of macro cells. This  option  is
              applicable  only  when the -leaf_max_transition option is speci-
              fied.

              The default is false.

       -routing_rule_for_sinks ndr_rule
              Specifies the nondefault routing rule to  be  used  for  routing
              clock  leaf nets in the specified clock trees. This option over-
              rides the -routing_rule option  when  routing  leaf-level  clock
              nets, if both options are specified.

       -buffer_relocation true | false
              Enables  and  disables  buffer relocation on the specified clock
              trees during the clock tree optimization that is performed  dur-
              ing  initial  clock  tree synthesis.  Note that this option does
              not  control  buffer   relocation   performed   by   the   opti-
              mize_clock_tree command.

              The default is true.

       -buffer_sizing true | false
              Enables  or  disables buffer sizing on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock  tree synthesis. Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is true.

       -gate_relocation true | false
              Enables or disables gate relocation on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock tree synthesis.  Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is true.

       -gate_sizing true | false
              Enables  or  disables  gate  sizing on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock tree synthesis.  Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is false.

       -logic_level_balance true | false
              Enables  or disables building the clock tree with balanced logic
              levels.

              The default is false.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -ocv_clustering true | false
              Enables  or disables on-chip-variation-aware register clustering
              for capturing timing-critical endpoints, to improve  clock  path
              sharing  between  the  relatively  more timing-critical register
              pairs. Any previous setup that can affect  the  timing  measured
              between  register  pairs,  such  as  the  set_clock_latency  and
              set_clock_uncertainty command, might affect the clustering  cri-
              teria and accordingly affect the resulting clock trees.

              The default is false.

       -ocv_path_sharing true | false
              Enables  or disables on-chip-variation-aware clock path sharing.
              When enabled, the tool attempts to  generate  clock  trees  with
              more shared paths among clock paths driving different clock end-
              points. The increase of path-sharing can help to decrease  clock
              skew  caused  by  on-chip-variation.  Clock  insertion delay can
              increase when this option is enabled.

              The default is true.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -advanced_drc_fixing true | false
              Enables  or  disables  the  advanced DRC fixing feature in clock
              tree synthesis and optimization.

              The default is false.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -config_file_read file_name
              Directs  clock tree synthesis to build the clock trees according
              to the configuration  defined  in  the  specified  configuration
              file.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -config_file_write file_name
              Directs clock tree synthesis to write out  the  specified  clock
              tree configuration file after performing clock tree synthesis.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -insert_boundary_cell true | false
              Enables or disables the insertion of boundary cells  near  clock
              input ports for block-level designs.

              The default is false.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -operating_condition  min | min_max | max
              Sets the operating condition at which clock tree synthesis  syn-
              thesizes the clock trees.

              By default, the operating condition is set to max.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

DESCRIPTION
       The general flow for synthesizing a clock tree is as follows:

      1. Trace the initial clock tree structure (based on the initial  netlist
         and  SDC commands). Based on the results, proceed to step 2 below, if
         needed.

      2. Define the clock tree exceptions (the set_clock_tree_exceptions  com-
         mand).

      3.  Specify  the buffers and inverters to use in the synthesis and opti-
         mization of the clock tree (the set_clock_tree_references command).

      4. Synthesize the clock tree and update  the  design  netlist  with  the
         legal placement results (the compile_clock_tree command).

       A  clock  tree  structure is defined from the pin of an instance called
       the source pin. It is assumed that the clock tree is to be  constructed
       from this source pin until leaf pins of sequential elements are encoun-
       tered. Exceptions are used to modify this assumption. After clock  tree
       exceptions  have  been added or modified, the clock tree can be synthe-
       sized.

       At minimum, specify the source pin of the clock tree to create an  ini-
       tial clock tree structure. (If source pin is not specified, the command
       defines the settings for all clock trees in the design.) After the def-
       inition  of  the clock tree has been created, other clock tree commands
       use the same source pin to do one or more of the following to the clock
       tree:

       o Add constraints to it
       o Add exceptions to it
       o Report on it
       o Synthesize it

       The  -clock_trees  option defines the pin that is the root, or starting
       point, of the clock tree. It must be a pin of a leaf cell, a hierarchi-
       cal port, or an input port of the top-level design.

       The set_clock_tree_references command specifies the library buffers and
       inverters to use for clock tree synthesis.

   Tracing Rules
       The following section assumes familiarity with the concepts  of  timing
       arcs,  timing  arc  unateness, combinational arcs, and sequential arcs.
       The following set of rules is applied to  determine  which  clock  tree
       nets  in  the  transitive  fanout  of the driving pin are buffered, and
       which load pins of those nets are considered as balance  points  during
       clock tree synthesis. The general rule is to gather a set of clock tree
       nets by iteratively tracing through cells in the clock network.   Trac-
       ing  starts at the net driven by the root pin and continues through the
       owning cells of its load pins when they meet the following conditions:

       o The output pin has at least one fanout.
       o The output pin is not on a pad net, which is a net between an I/O pad
         cell and a top-level port, such as a bonding net.
       o  There is at least one combinational timing arc between the input pin
         on the clock path and the output pin or there is a sequential  clock-
         to-output  data  arc and the related output is the source of a gener-
         ated clock.
       o There is no three-state enable or  disable  timing  arc  between  the
         input pin on the clock path and the output pin.

       If  more  than  one output on a cell meets these conditions, clock tree
       synthesis selects a random pin and generates a warning message indicat-
       ing which pin was chosen. Use the set_disable_timing command to disable
       as many unwanted timing arcs in the cell as needed to force a  specific
       output  pin  to  be  selected.  When both sequential arcs (to generated
       clock source pins) and combinational arcs  can  be  traced,  additional
       warning messages are issued.

       When  clock  tree synthesis traces through a cell to an output pin, the
       driven net becomes a clock tree  net  and  the  rules  are  iteratively
       applied  to  all  its  load pins to determine the other clock tree nets
       among the transitive fanout of this net.

       Clock tree synthesis does not trace through a clock positive-edge  arc,
       a  clock negative-edge arc, or a three-state enable arc. All other com-
       binational cell timing arcs are traced through.  This  includes  timing
       arcs of multiplexer cells or combinational arcs from data pins of latch
       cells (transparent mode). Sequential clock-gating cells are also traced
       through if there is a combinational arc connected to the clock path. By
       default, all nonclock pins of sequential elements,  except  three-state
       enable  or  disable  pins,  become  exclude  pins  unless  they have an
       explicit stop pin exception. For example, the following types  of  pins
       are implicitly excluded:

       o Pins of combinational cells without fanout
       o Pins of combinational cells with disabled timing arcs
       o Top-level output ports
       o Input pins of pad cells
       o Data pins of flip-flops or memories

       The -exceptions option of the report_clock_tree command reports implic-
       itly excluded pins as inferred.

       Applying the set_clock_tree_exceptions command with appropriate options
       to  some  pins in the transitive fanout of the clock root modifies this
       default behavior.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command has no dependency on scenario-specific information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets a target skew  of  0.050  ns  only  for  the
       my_clock clock tree:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_options \
                 -clock_trees my_clock -target_skew 0.050

       The following example adds an exception to exclude a fanout pin Reg0/CP
       from examination for skew optimization and analysis. This creates a new
       clock tree structure that takes into account this new exception:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_exceptions -exclude_pins [get_pins Reg0/CP]

       The  following  example  adds  an  exception to define pin Ram0/we as a
       float pin:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_exceptions -float_pins [get_pins RAM0/we]

       The following example reports the current definition of the CLK1  clock
       tree:

         prompt> report_clock_tree -clock_trees CLK1

ARGUMENTS
       -clock_trees clock_sources
              Specifies the clock trees on which to set  the  specified  clock
              tree  options.   You specify the clock trees by using the source
              of each clock tree. The source can be a top-level  design  input
              port, a hierarchical port, or a library cell instance pin.

              If  you  do  not  specify the -clock_trees option, the specified
              clock tree options apply to all clocks defined  in  the  design.
              Note  that  some clock tree options are global options and apply
              to all clocks in  the  design  regardless  of  the  -clock_trees
              option.  These  global  options are noted in the option descrip-
              tion.

       -layer_list layer_names
              Specifies the layers that can be used for routing the clock nets
              in  the  specified  clock  trees.  If the list has more than two
              elements, the lower layer should appear before the upper  layer.

              By default, all routing layers can be used for clock nets.

       -layer_list_for_sinks layer_names
              Specifies the layers that can be used for routing the clock leaf
              nets in the specified clock trees.  If the list  has  more  than
              two  elements,  the  lower  layer should appear before the upper
              layer. This option overrides the -layer_list option when routing
              leaf-level clock nets, if both options are specified.

       -use_leaf_routing_rule_for_sinks count
              Forces the leaf routing rule or leaf layerlist to be used on the
              leaf nets that drive the clock tree sinks and nets at the bottom
              n-1 levels of the clock tree. A net is considered as leaf net if
              it drives at least one flip-flop or latch clock input  pin  that
              is  a  sink  pin or float or stop pin.  Any pins with exclude or
              don't touch subtree exceptions, as well as non-flip-flop or non-
              latch  clock  input  pins with float or stop exceptions, are not
              treated as sink pins of the clock tree for  this  purpose.   For
              example,  a  net that drives only one non-flip-flop float pin is
              not treated as a leaf net for this purpose.

              The default is 0, and the maximum allowed is 2.

              This option is valid only if the -routing_rule_for_sinks or  the
              -layer_list_for_sinks option is specified.

       -target_early_delay insertion_delay
              Specifies  the minimum insertion delay constraint in design unit
              for the specified clock trees.

              When you specify this option, the clock  tree  synthesis  engine
              builds  an  initial optimized clock tree. If the insertion delay
              of the longest path of this clock tree is smaller than the spec-
              ified  value,  the  clock  tree synthesis engine adds a chain of
              cells from the reference list as needed to meet this delay.

              By default, the target early delay is 0.

       -target_skew skew
              Specifies the required value for maximum skew in design unit for
              the specified clock trees.

              After  the tool meets this skew target, the optimization concen-
              trates more on other QoR goals,  such  as  insertion  delay  and
              area).

              By default, the target skew is 0.

       -max_capacitance capacitance
              Specifies the maximum capacitance design rule constraint in main
              library units for the specified clock trees.

              This value takes precedence over the  maximum  capacitance  con-
              straint  set  on the design, as well as over the one coming from
              the library. This constraint  is  used  when  reporting  maximum
              capacitance  violations  during clock tree synthesis and is also
              used to control maximum capacitance  DRC  fixing  beyond  excep-
              tions.

              By default, the maximum capacitance is 0.6 pf.

       -max_transition transition_time
              Specifies  the maximum transition time design rule constraint in
              main library unit for the buffers and inverters used while  com-
              piling the specified clock trees.

              This  value  takes  precedence  over the maximum transition time
              constraint set on the design, as well as  over  the  one  coming
              from the library, but can be overridden on all instances of spe-
              cific types of buffers and inverters in the clock tree by speci-
              fying   a   different   value   for   this   constraint  on  the
              set_clock_tree_references command line. The clock tree root cell
              and  clock-gating  cells  present  on  the clock network are not
              affected  by  the  set_clock_tree_references  design  rule  con-
              straints  unless they are instances of buffers or inverters with
              overridden design rule constraints.

              By default, the maximum transition time is 0.5 ns.

       -max_fanout fanout
              Specifies the maximum fanout  design  rule  constraint  for  the
              cells in the specified clock trees.

              By  default,  the maximum fanout constraint set on the design by
              using the set_max_fanout command, as well as the one coming from
              the library are ignored during clock tree synthesis.

              By default, the maximum fanout is 2000.

       -max_rc_delay_constraint delay
              Specifies  the  maximum RC delay constraint from a driver pin to
              each receiver pin while compiling  the  specified  clock  trees.
              This  constraint  is  for  the  delay  from a driver pin to each
              receiver pin.

              By default, the maximum RC delay constraint is disabled.

              This option is mutually exclusive with the  -max_rc_scale_factor
              option.

       -max_rc_scale_factor scale_factor
              Enables  the  maximum  RC delay constraint by specifying a scale
              factor while compiling the specified clock trees.  The  true  RC
              delay  constraint is determined by multiplying this scale factor
              by an internally derived RC delay. This constraint  is  for  the
              delay from a driver pin to each receiver pin.

              By default, the scale factor is not set and the maximum RC delay
              constraint is disabled.

              This option is mutually exclusive  with  the  -max_rc_delay_con-
              straint option.

       -routing_rule ndr_rule
              Specifies  the  nondefault  routing  rule to be used for routing
              nets in the specified clock trees.

              The default is to use the default routing  rule  for  all  clock
              nets.

       -use_default_routing_for_sinks count
              Forces the default routing rule to be used on the leaf nets that
              drive the clock tree sinks and nets at the bottom n-1 levels  of
              the  clock tree. A net is considered as leaf net if it drives at
              least one flip-flop or latch clock input pin  that  is  a  sink,
              float,  or  stop pin.  Any pins with exclude or don't touch sub-
              tree exceptions, as well as  non-flip-flop  or  non-latch  clock
              input  pins  with  float  or stop exceptions, are not treated as
              sink pins of the clock tree for this purpose.   For  example,  a
              net  that drives only one non-flip-flop float pin is not treated
              as a leaf net for this purpose.

              The default is 0.

              This option is valid only if the -routing_rule option is  speci-
              fied.

       -leaf_max_transition transition_time
              Specifies  the maximum transition time design rule constraint in
              main library unit for the buffers and inverters used while  syn-
              thesizing  the leaf nets during the compilation of the specified
              clock trees. A leaf net is defined as a  net  which  drives  the
              clock pin of at least one register, latch, or multibit register.

              This value must be tighter than the  value  specified  with  the
              -max_transition  option of the set_clock_tree_options command or
              the set_max_transition command.

              By default, the maximum transition constraint for the leaf  nets
              is equal to the maximum transition constraint of the rest of the
              clock tree.

       -use_leaf_max_transition_on_exceptions true | false
              Specifies if the maximum transition constraint applied  on  leaf
              level  nets by using the -leaf_max_transition option should also
              apply on nets connected to pins having exceptions on them.  This
              option  is  applicable only when the -leaf_max_transition option
              is specified.

              The default is false.

       -use_leaf_max_transition_on_macros true | false
              Specifies if the maximum transition constraint applied  on  leaf
              level  nets by using the -leaf_max_transition option should also
              apply on nets connected to pins of macro cells. This  option  is
              applicable  only  when the -leaf_max_transition option is speci-
              fied.

              The default is false.

       -routing_rule_for_sinks ndr_rule
              Specifies the nondefault routing rule to  be  used  for  routing
              clock  leaf nets in the specified clock trees. This option over-
              rides the -routing_rule option  when  routing  leaf-level  clock
              nets, if both options are specified.

       -buffer_relocation true | false
              Enables  and  disables  buffer relocation on the specified clock
              trees during the clock tree optimization that is performed  dur-
              ing  initial  clock  tree synthesis.  Note that this option does
              not  control  buffer   relocation   performed   by   the   opti-
              mize_clock_tree command.

              The default is true.

       -buffer_sizing true | false
              Enables  or  disables buffer sizing on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock  tree synthesis. Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is true.

       -gate_relocation true | false
              Enables or disables gate relocation on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock tree synthesis.  Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is true.

       -gate_sizing true | false
              Enables  or  disables  gate  sizing on the specified clock trees
              during the clock tree optimization that is performed during ini-
              tial  clock tree synthesis.  Note that this option does not con-
              trol buffer relocation performed by the optimize_clock_tree com-
              mand.

              The default is false.

       -logic_level_balance true | false
              Enables  or disables building the clock tree with balanced logic
              levels.

              The default is false.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -ocv_clustering true | false
              Enables  or disables on-chip-variation-aware register clustering
              for capturing timing-critical endpoints, to improve  clock  path
              sharing  between  the  relatively  more timing-critical register
              pairs. Any previous setup that can affect  the  timing  measured
              between  register  pairs,  such  as  the  set_clock_latency  and
              set_clock_uncertainty command, might affect the clustering  cri-
              teria and accordingly affect the resulting clock trees.

              The default is false.

       -ocv_path_sharing true | false
              Enables  or disables on-chip-variation-aware clock path sharing.
              When enabled, the tool attempts to  generate  clock  trees  with
              more shared paths among clock paths driving different clock end-
              points. The increase of path-sharing can help to decrease  clock
              skew  caused  by  on-chip-variation.  Clock  insertion delay can
              increase when this option is enabled.

              The default is true.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -advanced_drc_fixing true | false
              Enables  or  disables  the  advanced DRC fixing feature in clock
              tree synthesis and optimization.

              The default is false.

              This is a global option; it affects all clock  trees  regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -config_file_read file_name
              Directs  clock tree synthesis to build the clock trees according
              to the configuration  defined  in  the  specified  configuration
              file.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -config_file_write file_name
              Directs clock tree synthesis to write out  the  specified  clock
              tree configuration file after performing clock tree synthesis.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -insert_boundary_cell true | false
              Enables or disables the insertion of boundary cells  near  clock
              input ports for block-level designs.

              The default is false.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

       -operating_condition  min | min_max | max
              Sets the operating condition at which clock tree synthesis  syn-
              thesizes the clock trees.

              By default, the operating condition is set to max.

              This  is  a global option; it affects all clock trees regardless
              of the -clock_trees option.

DESCRIPTION
       The general flow for synthesizing a clock tree is as follows:

      1. Trace the initial clock tree structure (based on the initial  netlist
         and  SDC commands). Based on the results, proceed to step 2 below, if
         needed.

      2. Define the clock tree exceptions (the set_clock_tree_exceptions  com-
         mand).

      3.  Specify  the buffers and inverters to use in the synthesis and opti-
         mization of the clock tree (the set_clock_tree_references command).

      4. Synthesize the clock tree and update  the  design  netlist  with  the
         legal placement results (the compile_clock_tree command).

       A  clock  tree  structure is defined from the pin of an instance called
       the source pin. It is assumed that the clock tree is to be  constructed
       from this source pin until leaf pins of sequential elements are encoun-
       tered. Exceptions are used to modify this assumption. After clock  tree
       exceptions  have  been added or modified, the clock tree can be synthe-
       sized.

       At minimum, specify the source pin of the clock tree to create an  ini-
       tial clock tree structure. (If source pin is not specified, the command
       defines the settings for all clock trees in the design.) After the def-
       inition  of  the clock tree has been created, other clock tree commands
       use the same source pin to do one or more of the following to the clock
       tree:

       o Add constraints to it
       o Add exceptions to it
       o Report on it
       o Synthesize it

       The  -clock_trees  option defines the pin that is the root, or starting
       point, of the clock tree. It must be a pin of a leaf cell, a hierarchi-
       cal port, or an input port of the top-level design.

       The set_clock_tree_references command specifies the library buffers and
       inverters to use for clock tree synthesis.

   Tracing Rules
       The following section assumes familiarity with the concepts  of  timing
       arcs,  timing  arc  unateness, combinational arcs, and sequential arcs.
       The following set of rules is applied to  determine  which  clock  tree
       nets  in  the  transitive  fanout  of the driving pin are buffered, and
       which load pins of those nets are considered as balance  points  during
       clock tree synthesis. The general rule is to gather a set of clock tree
       nets by iteratively tracing through cells in the clock network.   Trac-
       ing  starts at the net driven by the root pin and continues through the
       owning cells of its load pins when they meet the following conditions:

       o The output pin has at least one fanout.
       o The output pin is not on a pad net, which is a net between an I/O pad
         cell and a top-level port, such as a bonding net.
       o  There is at least one combinational timing arc between the input pin
         on the clock path and the output pin or there is a sequential  clock-
         to-output  data  arc and the related output is the source of a gener-
         ated clock.
       o There is no three-state enable or  disable  timing  arc  between  the
         input pin on the clock path and the output pin.

       If  more  than  one output on a cell meets these conditions, clock tree
       synthesis selects a random pin and generates a warning message indicat-
       ing which pin was chosen. Use the set_disable_timing command to disable
       as many unwanted timing arcs in the cell as needed to force a  specific
       output  pin  to  be  selected.  When both sequential arcs (to generated
       clock source pins) and combinational arcs  can  be  traced,  additional
       warning messages are issued.

       When  clock  tree synthesis traces through a cell to an output pin, the
       driven net becomes a clock tree  net  and  the  rules  are  iteratively
       applied  to  all  its  load pins to determine the other clock tree nets
       among the transitive fanout of this net.

       Clock tree synthesis does not trace through a clock positive-edge  arc,
       a  clock negative-edge arc, or a three-state enable arc. All other com-
       binational cell timing arcs are traced through.  This  includes  timing
       arcs of multiplexer cells or combinational arcs from data pins of latch
       cells (transparent mode). Sequential clock-gating cells are also traced
       through if there is a combinational arc connected to the clock path. By
       default, all nonclock pins of sequential elements,  except  three-state
       enable  or  disable  pins,  become  exclude  pins  unless  they have an
       explicit stop pin exception. For example, the following types  of  pins
       are implicitly excluded:

       o Pins of combinational cells without fanout
       o Pins of combinational cells with disabled timing arcs
       o Top-level output ports
       o Input pins of pad cells
       o Data pins of flip-flops or memories

       The -exceptions option of the report_clock_tree command reports implic-
       itly excluded pins as inferred.

       Applying the set_clock_tree_exceptions command with appropriate options
       to  some  pins in the transitive fanout of the clock root modifies this
       default behavior.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command has no dependency on scenario-specific information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets a target skew  of  0.050  ns  only  for  the
       my_clock clock tree:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_options \
                 -clock_trees my_clock -target_skew 0.050

       The following example adds an exception to exclude a fanout pin Reg0/CP
       from examination for skew optimization and analysis. This creates a new
       clock tree structure that takes into account this new exception:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_exceptions -exclude_pins [get_pins Reg0/CP]

       The  following  example  adds  an  exception to define pin Ram0/we as a
       float pin:

         prompt> set_clock_tree_exceptions -float_pins [get_pins RAM0/we]

       The following example reports the current definition of the CLK1  clock
       tree:

         prompt> report_clock_tree -clock_trees CLK1
