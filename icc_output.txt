ARGUMENTS
       -control_type aspect_ratio | width_and_height | boundary
              Specifies how the command sizes the core area of the  floorplan.
              The  aspect_ratio  control  type specifies the area based on the
              ratio of  the  core  height  divided  by  the  core  width.  The
              width_and_height  control  type  specifies the area based on the
              true dimensions of the core. The boundary control type specifies
              the  area  based  on the place and route boundary of the current
              design. The default control type is aspect_ratio.

       -core_aspect_ratio ratio
              Specifies the aspect ratio for the floorplan. The  aspect  ratio
              is the height divided by the width. For example, an aspect ratio
              of 1.00 specifies a  square  core  area  with  equal  width  and
              height. An aspect ratio of 3.00 specifies a height that is three
              times the width. An aspect ratio of 0.50 specifies a width  that
              is two times the height. Note that the specified aspect ratio is
              only a target. The tool creates the floorplan  with  the  actual
              core area perimeter as close as possible to the specified aspect
              ratio.

       -core_utilization ratio
              Specifies the utilization for the core area. The utilization  is
              the  total  area  of the core occupied by all standard cells and
              macro cells divided by the total core area. You  can  specify  a
              utilization  value  between  0 and 1. The cell area includes all
              standard and macro cells. For example, a core utilization of 0.8
              specifies  that  80  percent  of  the core area is used for cell
              placement and 20 percent is available for routing.  This  option
              is only valid when you specify the -control_type option.

       -core_width width
              Specifies  the  width  of the core area. The unit is in microns.
              This option is only valid when  you  specify  the  -control_type
              width_and_height option.

       -core_height height
              Specifies  the  height of the core area. The unit is in microns.
              This option is only valid when  you  specify  the  -control_type
              width_and_height option.

       -use_vertical_row
              Specifies  that  the  command places cell rows vertically in the
              core area. If you do not specify this option, the command places
              cell rows horizontally in the core area.

       -no_double_back
              Specifies  that  the  command  places pairs of cell rows without
              flipping one row in each pair. By default, the command flips one
              cell row in each cell row pair.

       -start_first_row
              Specifies that cell row pairing begins at the bottom of the core
              area for horizontally placed cell rows or the left side  of  the
              core  area for vertically placed cell rows. This option is mutu-
              ally exclusive with the -no_double_back option. If  this  option
              is  not  used,  cell row pairing might or might not begin at the
              very first row. The cell row pairing does not begin at the  very
              first  row  when  the  wire  track  creation forces to have gaps
              between row pairs.

       -flip_first_row
              Specifies that the command flips the first row at the bottom  of
              the core area for horizontally placed cell rows, or the leftmost
              row for vertically placed cell rows.  This  option  is  mutually
              exclusive with the -no_double_back option.

       -left_io2core distance
              Specifies  the  distance  between the left side of the core area
              and the right side of the closest terminal or pad. The  unit  is
              in microns.

       -right_io2core distance
              Specifies  the  distance between the right side of the core area
              and the left side of the closest terminal or pad. The unit is in
              microns.

       -bottom_io2core distance
              Specifies  the distance between the bottom side of the core area
              and the top side of the closest terminal or pad. The unit is  in
              microns.

       -top_io2core distance
              Specifies the distance between the top side of the core area and
              the bottom side of the closest terminal or pad. The unit  is  in
              microns.

       -keep_macro_place
              Specifies  that  the  command keeps the placement of macro cells
              and does not move them.

       -keep_std_cell_place
              Specifies that the command keeps the placement of standard cells
              and does not move them.

       -min_pad_height
              Specifies  that the die area is based on the minimum pad height.
              Generally speaking, die area becomes smaller because bigger pads
              will overlap the core.

       -pad_limit
              Specifies  that  the  command  places pads with no space between
              pads.

       -keep_io_place
              Specifies that the command keeps the location of  terminals  and
              pads,  even if you previously specified I/O constraints by using
              theread_io_constraints command.

DESCRIPTION
       The create_floorplan command  performs  floorplanning  on  the  current
       design. Before running this command, you must open a physical design by
       using the open_mw_cel command.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command has no dependency on scenario-specific information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example creates a floorplan using the default settings:

         prompt> open_mw_cel top -lib design
         {top}
         prompt> create_floorplan -control_type aspect_ratio \
           -core_utilization 0.7
         1
